					<h2><br/><h2>Dude, go to Donair Dude.</h2>
					<p>Every time I visit Seattle, I plan a mini trip to nearby Vancouver too. In Vancouver the food is better, the nature is breathtaking, it's modern, it's clean, and Canadians are nice. This vibrant city is one of my favorite places in the world, offering some of the best urban culture, cuisine, and nature all at once.
					<p>Vancouver's diverse population makes for an abundant variety of restaurants, but careful not to overlook the small fast food either. So yes, to donair. The city is a fusion melting pot, offering meals that will leave your tastebuds replete. For seafood, Fanny Bay Oyster Bar doesn't seem outwardly convincing, but let me tell you-- their spicy mussels are damn good.
					<p>The outdoors are always calling. You'll see mountains or the ocean everywhere you look. Rent a bike and ride along the shore of Stanley Park. This park is one of the largest in North America, and has beautiful beaches and trails tucked away from the high-rises downtown. For a thrill, cross the bridge at Capilano Suspension Bridge Park and walks through the tree tops. Inside the park, you can get coffee and ‚ÄúBeaver Balls‚Äù which doesn't sound appetizing at all, but they're essentially just bite-size pancakes. Do not feed the squirrels.<br><br>

			<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you're thinking about using Uber in Vancouver, think again. Oddly enough, B.C. doesn't allow ride sharing services...<a href=‚Äùhttps://globalnews.ca/news/4015343/uber-app-bc-visitors/‚Äù>an uber inconvenience indeed.</a>
